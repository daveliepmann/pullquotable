pullquotable
============

"Is this text selection short enough to pull-quote?"

I like to tweet links alongside a hopefully-interesting pull quote. I became frustrated doing this without knowing *a priori* if the text I'd like to quote is short enough to fit the 140-character limit. I built this to tell me how many characters are in the text I'm selecting.

Installation
-
Go to [daveliepmann.com/pullquotable/bookmarklet](http://www.daveliepmann.com/pullquotable/bookmarklet) and follow the instructions. Or, if you'd rather do it manually, put the appropriate javascript statement from `pullquotable.js` into a bookmark in your bookmarks bar.

You can customize `pullquotable` to any color you like, as long as it's green or you modify the javascript yourself :)

Usage
-
 1. Click the bookmark once to toggle `pullquotable` on.
 1. Select some text and see how many characters it is.
 1. Click the bookmark again to toggle `pullquotable` off.
 1. Bask in the glory of knowing whether it will fit in your next brilliant twitterpation.

**Nota Bene**: Twitter's URL shortener [seems to take up 22 (23 for https) characters](http://support.conversocial.com/entries/23471033-How-many-characters-do-URLs-use-on-Twitter-), making **117**, not 140, the magic number.
